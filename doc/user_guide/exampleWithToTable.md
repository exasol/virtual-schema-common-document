# Example of `toTableMapping`

In this guide we want to map a documents like the following to an Exasol table:

```json
{
  "isbn": "1763413749",
  "name": "Accessing NoSQL-Databases in Exasol using Virtual Schemas",
  "topics": ["DynamoDB", "Exasol"]
}
```

In addition we know that `isbn` is a unique property (for example since it is a primary key in the data source). 

We want to map such documents to the following relational structure:

Note that `BOOKS_TOPICS` uses `ISBN` as FOREIGN KEY.

To achieve this we create the following mapping definition:

```
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.exasol.com/edml-1.0.0.json",
  "source": "MY_BOOKS",
  "destinationTable": "BOOKS",
  "description": "Maps MY_BOOKS to BOOKS",
  "mapping": {
    "fields": {
      "isbn": {
        "toVarcharMapping": {
          "varcharColumnSize": 20,
          "overflowBehaviour": "ABORT",
          "key": "global"
        }
      },
      "name": {
        "toVarcharMapping": {
          "varcharColumnSize": 100,
          "overflowBehaviour": "TRUNCATE"
        }
      },
      "topics": {
        "toTableMapping": {
          "mapping": {
            "toVarcharMapping": {
              "destinationName": "NAME"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Virtual Schema adapter automatically adds a foreign key to the table. In the example above, it adds
 the column `BOOKS_ISBN` to the `BOOKS_TOPICS` table. It did pick the `ISBN` column, because we marked 
 it as a key column.
 
 ## Key Types
 
 There are two different types of key: `global` and `local`. The difference only plays a role when mapping multi level nested lists.
 
 Consider the following example:
 A book contains multiple chapters and a chapter again can contain multiple figures.
 If in that example a chapter has a global key, that means, it is unique over all existing chapters (also across books).
 If it defines a local key, it is only unique over all chapters of that book.
 
 ## Autogenerated Keys
 
 If the data source supports it, the virtual schema adapter can also fetch the keys from the data source.
 In that case, the adapter will use a column as foreign key that is a unique key in the data source.
 
If you did not mark any column as key and the adapter could not detects any key column, it will add an `INDEX` column.
These columns contain the position of the element in the nested list.
So  in the example from above `DynamoDB` will receive the index 0 and `Exasol` the index 1.
